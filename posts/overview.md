# Overview

LitePub is a static blog generator that tries to be as easy to use as possible.
![alt text](/img/img5.jpg "Title")

It requires no software dependencies, needs no configuration files, uses no
databases. All it needs is one binary, posts written in
[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and a set of templates to
render the posts to static HTML files.

Posts don't have to include any special metadata (aka front matter) like title
or date in them - the title, date and optional tags are parsed from
the natural flow of the posts.
